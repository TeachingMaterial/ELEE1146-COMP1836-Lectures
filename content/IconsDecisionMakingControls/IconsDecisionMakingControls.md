## Radio Buttons and RadioGroups Controls

[Documentation for Radio\<controls\>](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/RadioGroup?hl=en)

A `RadioButton` control selects or deselects an option
- Can be arranged horizontally or vertically (by default)
- Has a label defined by the text property
- Can be initially set to checked or unchecked
- Typically used together in a `RadioGroup`
- Only one `RadioButton` in the group can be selected at a time
- Good to offer a default selection (checked == `true`) for the option that is used most
