## Module Aims

The main aims of this module are to develop [your] understanding and practical skills in object-oriented programming and to introduce the principles of mobile application design and development to the [you].

---

## Module Learning Outcomes 

On successful completion of this module a student will be able to:

[1] have an in-depth understanding of object-oriented concepts and constructs

[2] understand multithreading

[3] understand the basic principles of mobile applications development

[4] design and implement mobile applications

---

## Indicative Content

Encapsulation and Information Hiding, Constructors, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Interfaces, Exception Handling, Files and Streams, Threads, User Interface Design, Widgets, Activities, Views, Intents, Menus, 2D and 3D Graphics, Animation.

--- 

## Teaching and Learning Activities

This module will be taught based on a problem-solving approach. [You] will be given specific problems to solve with the underpinning material supplied by lectures and tutorials.

At the end of this module, [you] will be able to undertake an engineering challenge such as designing and developing a mobile app. An example app might be a mobile game (like Sudoku or tic tac toe). The app will be developed using the basic principles of mobile development technology and incorporating various additional features like animated user interface, playing music and sound effects.

Learning and teaching will be by a combination of:
- Lectures/tutorials/laboratory sessions (face-to-face, video or computer mediated)
- Individual or group-based teaching tutorial/project
- Self-study supported structured learning materials
